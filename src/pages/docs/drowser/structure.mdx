## Report

The `drowser-reports.json` file provides a comprehensive overview of the test execution metrics and individual test case details. This file is generated after running your tests and can be used to analyze the results and performance of your test suite.

You can import the `drowser-reports.json` file into the [Drowser Studio](https://drowser.kinotio.io/) to visualize and analyze the metrics for each test case. This helps in identifying issues, understanding test coverage, and improving the overall quality of your test suite.

For more details on how to use [Drowser Studio](https://drowser.kinotio.io/), refer to the [Drowser Studio Repository](https://github.com/kinotio/drowser-studio).
